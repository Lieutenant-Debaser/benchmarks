# benchmarks
This is a selection of benchmarks I've written just for fun and to also gauge the performance of computers. These benchmarks should not be taken as definitive, and the results should not be used in place of professional benchmarks.

Also, any damage you do to your machines as a result of using any of the code available here in any capacity is your sole responsibility.
